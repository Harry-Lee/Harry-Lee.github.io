      <description>Don&amp;rsquo;t know how to configure SSL certificate? Just started learning about how to deploy your own secure website but don&amp;rsquo;t want to spend money purchasing a SSL certificate? Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt (now Certbot) is here to save the day!
Background Letâ€™s Encrypt is a free, automated, and open Certificate Authority.
Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt is an official Certificate Authority. This means that the SSL certificate provided/generated by Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt is recognised by all browsers as being legitimate.</description>
