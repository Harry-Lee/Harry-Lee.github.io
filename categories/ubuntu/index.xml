      <description>Docker already has an official documentation with tutorials and examples on how to go about setting up your own Docker Swarm nodes and cluster. This post is intended for those who have a fundamental grasp on Docker and are too lazy to read the documents. This post includes minimal explanation and focuses primarily on the configuration. It is written to be a series of instructions rather than a full fledged post.</description>

      <description>To configure your own VPN hosted on your own VPS is not difficult at all, especially when there are numerous configuration scripts lying around the internet. We will set up such a VPN using Docker hosted on a Microsoft Azure VM.
Set Up Listed below is my set up. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to use the exact set up as me, as the configurations should be the same with any VM (Virtual Machine) running Docker (that&amp;rsquo;s the beauty of Docker!</description>

      <description>There are many tools that can be used for debugging when developing a web app using PHP. These debugging tools are very useful in a local development environment, you can view the states of variables, indicate line breaks etc. However, these tools become difficult to use when you decide to include Docker in your workflow.
This post outlines the configuration needed to incorporate the debugging power of the PhpStorm IDE to your PHP based web app.</description>

      <description>Don&amp;rsquo;t know how to configure SSL certificate? Just started learning about how to deploy your own secure website but don&amp;rsquo;t want to spend money purchasing a SSL certificate? Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt (now Certbot) is here to save the day!
Background  Letâ€™s Encrypt is a free, automated, and open Certificate Authority.
 Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt is an official Certificate Authority. This means that the SSL certificate provided/generated by Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt is recognised by all browsers as being legitimate.</description>

      <title>Ubuntu: Backup files regularly using expect, rsync and Cron</title>

      <description>Want to backup your remote files at regular intervals? This post is for you.
This post focuses on: rsync, expect and cron. To access the remote server, I&amp;rsquo;m assuming that you are using ssh (with password authentication) for that. If you use ftp or other protocols, you will have to tweak the instructions a bit. If you are using SSH with public key (well done!), you will have to tweak the rsync command to use public key.</description>

      <title>Ubuntu: Suspend and reboot at specific times using Cron</title>

      <description>If you have a server at home and you want it to be on only during specific times and not 24/7, this script is for you.
Cron not only is the best tool for this, it also handles scheduled tasks.
 Cron is a system daemon used to execute desired tasks (in the background) at designated times.
 Method   Install Cron on Ubuntu if it is not already installed.</description>

      <title>Ubuntu: Sharing externally connected drives over network</title>
      <link>https://harrylee.me/blog/2015-01-10-ubuntu-sharing-externally-connected-drives-over-network/</link>

      <description>When you have external drives connected to the server, it would be very useful if you can share these drives to users accessing the server as well. This is useful if you have a home media server with externally connected drives.
This post aims to share drives that are NTFS formatted and changing the permissions of the mounted drives.
Method   Unmount the drive that is connected already and remount to another folder giving permissions to users.</description>
