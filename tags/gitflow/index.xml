      <description>This post describes a simplified Git branching strategy to software versioning and release. This strategy is a slightly simplified version of GitFLow. This strategy does not contradict GitFlow in terms of software development (you can still use feature/* branches), but rather a slight deviation on the release side of GitFlow.
Introduction This branching model is a recommendation to the existing GitFlow for a simpler software release cycle. This model is unbiased in terms of the development workflow, as long as you have a development branch you can use this strategy.</description>
