<p>When you have external drives connected to the server, it would be very <strong>useful</strong> if you can <strong>share these drives</strong> to <em>users</em> accessing the server as well. This is useful if you have a home media server with externally connected drives.</p>

<p>This post aims to <strong>share drives</strong> that are NTFS formatted and changing the permissions of the mounted drives.</p>

<h3 id="method">Method</h3>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Unmount the drive</strong> that is connected already and <strong>remount</strong> to another folder giving permissions to users.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">   $ sudo umount -l /dev/sdX1
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>sdX1</code> is the device ID.</p>

<p>To <strong>check</strong> the device ID, execute:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">    $ df
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">    $ lsblk
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Remount</strong> to another folder.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">   $ sudo mount -t ntfs-3g -o rw /dev/sdX1 /media/path/to/folder
</code></pre>

<p>This <strong>assumes</strong> that you are connecting a <strong>NTFS formatted drive</strong>.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Change the permission</strong> of the mount point to allow access to users.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">   $ sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /media/path/to/folder
</code></pre>

<p>This gives permission, both <strong>read and write</strong>, to the logged in user that accesses the drive. You can adjust this accordingly.</p></li>
</ol>
